In the year 2012 we have started a multi story exquisite shopping paradise in the heart of the city to give Surat a complete family shopping experience. We have always attempted to merge the international standers with the skills of Indian art and culture. Paris has proved that contemporary designers must revitalize their own roots and identity. It was essential to take Indian creativity out into the world in such a way that benefited both craftsmen and the modern consumer. It has been 3 years that we are serving the people of Surat and have been successful to attract the crowd from major cities in Gujarat and outskirts. There is an enigmatic curiosity and fascination for our special NRI collection, as we are the only choice of N.R.I. and a giant; to export the wedding trousseaus across the globe.

The best bit of our garment is the flexibility of our material. The label strikes the perfect balance between the prêt and the haute couture which combined with our uncanny ability to trend forecast which is the major reason of our success.</p>
